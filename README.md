# Simon-game
Here's the link to the game : https://anshuman235.github.io/Simon-game/

So here's how the simon game work.

Out of 4 colours, the game will flick of the colours. Now we have to click that colour. That was level 1 passed.

After that, the game will flick another colour and we then we have to tell the order from the starting.
Basically we have to remember the order from the starting and click in the order simon tells us to.
